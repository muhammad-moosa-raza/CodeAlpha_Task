**Creditworthiness Prediction Using Logistic Regression**

This repository contains a simple implementation of a machine learning model to predict creditworthiness based on financial data. The project demonstrates the use of Logistic Regression for binary classification and evaluates its performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report metrics.

**Key Features**

Dataset: A simulated dataset with features such as age, income, loan amount, and credit history.
Model Training: Logistic Regression is used to classify individuals as creditworthy or not.
Performance Evaluation: The model is evaluated on a test set with detailed metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Steps in the Code**

Dataset Creation:
A simulated dataset is generated with features representing financial and credit data.
Data Preprocessing:
Features (age, income, loan_amount, credit_history) are separated from the target (creditworthy).
Train-Test Split:
The data is split into training and testing sets (70-30 split).
Model Training:
Logistic Regression is used to train the model on the training dataset.
Model Evaluation:
Predictions are made on the test set, and metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are generated to assess model performance.

**Results**

The output includes:
Model accuracy on the test set.
A confusion matrix showing true/false positives and negatives.
A detailed classification report including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
